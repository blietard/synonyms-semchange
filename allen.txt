CROSS  REFERENCES 

Every  cross  reference  from  a  word  is  to  some  other  synonymous  word, 
under  which  it  is  given  either  merely  as  a  synonym  or  by  way  of  a  recip- 
rocal reference  at  the  end.  This  latter  is  often  done  where  there  are 
two  groups  of  synonyms  of  overlapping  signification. 

The  matter  in  smaller  type  at  the  foot  of  the  page  consists  entirely 
of  cross  references,  the  words  in  the  italic  type  in  each  case  having,  under 
the  main  vocabulary  entrance,  a  list  of  synonyms  including  the  word 
referred  from.  Thus,  "obloquy:  abuse,  discredit"  means:  "see  in  the 
main  Vocabulary  the  words  abuse  and  discredit,  where  the  word  obloquy 
will  be  found  as  one  of  the  several  synonyms  of  the  other  words." 


DIVIDING  NUMBERS 

Under  many  of  the  vocabulary  entries  the  synonyms  are  divided 
into  numbered  groups,  so  as  to  keep  together  the  synonyms  for  any  one 
sense,  because  the  synonyms  of  a  word  in  one  sense  usually  differ  in 
whole  or  in  part  from  the  synonyms  of  the  word  in  a  different  sense. 
Where  the  distinction  between  the  senses  is  not  obvious,  I  have  intro- 
duced a  brief  hint  or  definition  so  as  to  make  this  plain,  as  under  abridg- 
ment, arrangement,  ask,  v.  t.,  assembly,  base,  n.,  beak.  Frequently  the 
difference  in  meaning  between  the  senses  is  made  clear  or  more  obvious  by 
the  following  antonyms,  as  under  absolute,  ask,  v.  t.,  branch,  body,  benefit.
